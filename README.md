# ProposalGame

I learned how to make a video game to propose to my now fiancee. I knew very little about programming and modeling. I used Unity Engine for the video game, Visual Studio for code in C#, and Blender for creating models. 

I used the following Unity Assets:
- Low Poly Cloud Generator by NoobStudios
- Snowy Low-Poly Trees by False Wisp Studios
- Low Poly Shaders by Broken Vector
- Light Beams by Mario Lelas
- Camera Path Creator by Icch_howw
- CN Controls by Kirill Nadezhdin
- Post Processing Stack
- Low Poly Water GPU by Jolix
- TextMesh Pro
- Low Poly Style - Tree Pack by Agile Reaction

Special thanks to Brackeys and Sebastian Lague for their excellent tutorials. I've learned everything I know from them. Unless this game is terrible. In that case, they are definitely not related to this project.
